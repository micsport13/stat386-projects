&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will be analyzing stock data pulled from AlphaVantage’s API, namely the FAANG Stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google or Alphabet).  I wanted to compare these stocks and see how some of the trends that these stocks followed.  Since these companies have been grouped together because they are within the same industry, I suspect we will see some correlation but let’s see what the data says.  If you would like to see how this data was obtained, please refer to my last post &lt;a href=&quot;https://micsport13.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/webscraping-post.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  If you would like to know how to create these charts from the data, please refer to the link at the bottom of this post.  Let’s get into it! (Also, I colored the charts that match the colors of the companies they represent)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;data-collection&quot;&gt;Data Collection&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, one of the things I wanted to do was draw a line plot with all of the stocks overlayed, just to get a general idea of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/stat386-projects/assets/images/EDA/FAANG_lineplot.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the plot, we can see all of the stock prices for the companies within the FAANG group.  Most of the stocks have similar prices with the exception of Netflix, which costs more per share.  It is important to note that during this time period, Google went through a 20:1 split and so the data has been adjusted accordingly to accomodate this split.  Amazon also went through a split but not during the time period of the data and so has already been adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I wanted to compare the differences of the intraday highs achieved by each stock which is shown below.  Interestingly, Netflix was the only stock that had outliers, indicating over the course of the previous 100 days of stock trading (August 28th-November 16th is the time period for the collected data).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/stat386-projects/assets/images/EDA/FAANG_boxplot_highs.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting measurement is to compare the intraday ranges for stocks.  I calculated this by taking the difference between the high and low and divided this value by the adjusted close of the stock.  This was done to account for the differences in price of the stock. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/stat386-projects/assets/images/EDA/FAANG_boxplot_differences.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to compare the volume of the shares, which represents the total number of shares sold over the course of the day.  As shown in the graph, many of the shares have similar amounts of traded shares.  Often times, on certain days, the total amount of trading will spike, such as in the case of tech news or major economic news. In the increase of share volume, it may be an indication of news with the stock and is helpful in identifying events related to the stock.
&lt;img src=&quot;/stat386-projects/assets/images/EDA/FAANG_lineplot_volume.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I wanted to compare the total amount of money traded per day.  I created a plot that shows all of the plots that compares all of the shares and the total amount of money traded during the course of the day.  That plot is shown below.
&lt;img src=&quot;/stat386-projects/assets/images/EDA/FAANG_lineplot_totalvaluetraded.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown by this data, we can see how related stocks will have some similar characteristics and it helps us to understand how many stocks are influenced by the movement of other shares on the market.  In the next and final post, I will discuss how all of the data we collected turns into something that we can use to explain real life scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous posts (linked at the end of this post), we explored the data more in depth to come to the conclusions we found in this post.  We first obtained the data from an API which allows us to access the newest data for any set of symbols.  We analyzed the economical trends of these five stocks over the past 100 days of trading (from August 28th to November 16th).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-weve-learned-after-collecting-the-data&quot;&gt;What we’ve learned after collecting the data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/stat386-projects/assets/images/FAANG_lineplot_FINAL.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to compare all of the FAANG stocks and compare the value of their shares over the course of time and look for anything in common.  Here is what I found most interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The stocks followed the same general pattern.  This was to be expected because these stocks are within the same economic sector and so trends generally follow across the entire industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generally, the biggest changes in price immediately followed either major economic news or earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes, even though they are within the same industry, the companies may not follow the daily movement of other companies, notably Netflix in the end of October.  Netflix went up in value whereas the other FAANG stocks fell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this project, I was able to answer the question of how FAANG stocks are related on an economic level.  Through this data collection and analysis, I have found many interesting insights and it shows that even though companies have varying policies and services, the industries of which they are apart are highly correlated and dependent.  It further illustrates the need to diversify one’s portfolio to cover risk that may accompany one specific industry (&lt;em&gt;I am not a financial expert and this doesn’t constitute financial advice&lt;/em&gt;).  I invite you to follow the steps outlined in my previous posts to create your own data story!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/stat386-projects/assets/images/how-api-works.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction-to-api-use&quot;&gt;Introduction to API use&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API (application programming interface) is a tool that is built into many web services that allow for applications to retrieve data from a server.  In the data science realm, this most often shows up as get requests, which are requests that pull information from the web server.  This is useful in obtaining the data used within web sites but are formatted in such a way that may make webscraping difficult or only a specific subset of the data is displayed on the website.  API’s are also useful in variable data, such as in the BYU app where it will call the API to figure out what your classes are and when they are.  This data will change on a semester basis but the underlying code doesn’t need to be changed that much because the application simply calls to the API created by BYU.  In this post, we will show how to use AlphaVantage’s API to pull stock data. Another benefit of API’s is that they have been purposely integrated into the web service so you know that your API calls are what the developers wanted and are ethical.  Just make sure to use the API as instructed by the documentation and terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;obtaining-an-api-key&quot;&gt;Obtaining an API key&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to limit the number of requests and limit the data to authorized users, API will often require authentication using keys.  In the case of AlphaVantage, they offer free keys to anyone who signs up for the service.  That can be done &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  When you sign up, it will generate an API key that you can save to your file.  Please remember that these keys are sensitive and should not be shared with anyone.  Additionally, remember that one of the best ways to protect your key is to save it in another file and simply read the file from your program.  You should not hard code your API key into your code, especially in the case that you open source the code.  Once you obtain the API key, continue on to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;calling-the-api&quot;&gt;Calling the API&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to start for API calls is the documentation.  When a company releases an API, it often comes with documentation for the API.  In the case of AlphaVantage, it is extremely simple.  It is structured like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=FUNCTION&amp;amp;symbol=SYMBOL&amp;amp;apikey=APIKEY &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
First is the function keyword, which is included in the API documentation.  Some of these functions are specifically premium features but it is listed in the documentation regarding which are premium and which are not.  A list of the functions can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Following the function keyword is the SYMBOL keyword which is simply the stock ticker symbol, which can be easily searched on google.  You can also search for symbols right here as well by searching for the company name (Note, this will redirect you to another site):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;form action=&quot;https://stockcharts.com/search&quot; method=&quot;GET&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;q&quot; class=&quot;search&quot; placeholder=&quot;Lookup stock: &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;section&quot; value=&quot;symbols&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Finally comes the APIKEY keyword which is where the API key is placed.  As mentioned before, &lt;b&gt;DO NOT&lt;/b&gt; include this key directly in your code.  Often times, you will read this value in to a variable and that variable can be passed using {} like so …&amp;amp;apikey={your_api_key_variable_here} which makes it easier to obscure your api key.  When all of these variables are put in place, the API will often return a JSON file with all of the data that you queried.  There are additional parameters that can be passed in but I will not cover them here.  I would refer to the documentation found at the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/stat386-projects/assets/images/alpha_vantage.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-bother&quot;&gt;Why bother?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the quantity of publicly available data, we may often ask ourselves,”Why bother?” The answer to this is simple.  API’s will make it simple in obtaining the data from the source and avoid having to deal with the formatting of certain webpages and will often include more data than is displayed on the website.  For this reason, API’s will be extremely helpful in obtaining the most useful and up-to-date data.  Using data pulled using this API, I will create a follow up post that includes analysis of the data obtained from this API.  There, it will be useful to see the connection of API use and data analysis. Stay tuned for more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important skill for Data Scientists is the ability to convey data in a way that is useful for others.  Using tools such as RMarkdown will make creating reports for your data significantly easier.  One of the best tools included in RMarkdown is LaTeX (commonly seen as $\LaTeX$ and pronounced lay-tech/tek), which essentially creates mathematical equations as you would see them in material such as websites and textbooks.  Many of the skills learned in this guide will directly translate to RMarkdown, as the syntax is largely the same. Here, I will make a basic guide to start you on your way to learning LaTeX as well as resources to help you find answers to any questions you have.  It is important to note that I don’t know everything about LaTeX and if you find that I missed something, feel free to leave a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 good starting places for LaTeX on your computer.  First, is an online resource called Overleaf.  It is a free web-based LaTeX editor that can compile your LaTeX code into PDF format for easy reports.  The only downside, in my opinion, is the need to create an account because I don’t like having to make an account for every website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative is to compile LaTeX on your local machine.  For Windows, the most common LaTeX typesetting system is MiKTeX, which comes with a TeX editor called TeXWorks.  For Macintosh, MacTeX is the typesetting system.  For Linux, TeXLive is the most common.  Additionally, there are a variety of editors for each of these platforms, including some that are multiplatform, that you can use to your needs and liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, this installation will take quite a while because there are such a large number of packages that are included in the base LaTeX installation.  After this installs, you should be able to open your LaTeX editor and begin typing in LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more help on installing for Windows, go &lt;a href=&quot;https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
For help installing on Mac, go &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tug.org/mactex/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
For Linux, due to the variety of distributions, I will simply say, Google is your friend here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-syntax&quot;&gt;Basic Syntax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaTeX is a powerful tool to format mathematical formulas in a way that is readable but that isn’t its only use.  It can also be used to format documents for reports that are readable and can even include images or charts from tools such as RStudio.  Many academic papers, especially within science and mathematics, are formatted with LaTeX so it is important to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create your first document, the following code will be helpful to create it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\documentclass{article}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\begin{document}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;First document. This is a simple example, with no&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;extra parameters or packages included.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\end{document}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\documentclass{article}&lt;/code&gt; defines the type of document you are creating.  This will call from templates installed on your computer already.  The second part combined with its closing tag is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\begin{document}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\end{document}&lt;/code&gt; is basically the content of your document.  Everything inside of these tags will be what shows up compiled into a PDF/other document format.  If any LaTeX code shows up outside of these tags, it will not appear within your document.  The following lines are plain text that will be included.  It is important to note that formatting is not included within this part and the fact that the content is on two lines doesn’t mean that it will appear that way on the document.  To create a new line, you will use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\\&lt;/code&gt; characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things in LaTeX is the ability to inline mathematical functions.  For example two-thirds can be represented in Latex as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$\frac{2}{3}$&lt;/code&gt; or $\frac{2}{3}$.  The dollar signs represent inline math functions.  Everything between the two dollar signs will be converted to a mathematical equation, assuming no syntax errors.  Additionally, there is a math mode that simply uses 2 dollar signs instead of one as is much more useful for long equations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within LaTeX, there are additional functions that allow you greater formatting within your document.  For example, you can create equations using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\begin{equation}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\end{equation}&lt;/code&gt; which will push the equation to the middle of the page.  These are most often called environments and will have specific formatting such as the equation environment shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PDF of the normal distribution is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{-1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these things will need to be included within the document tags to appear in your document.  Since this guide is not by any means exhaustive, I recommend that you try getting the environment setup on your computer and trying out LaTeX for yourself.  Whenever you run into an error, try checking the logs to see where the error was thrown and more often than not, it’s missing parenthesis or missing a closing tag for your environments.  When in doubt, Google for the specific error to determine the specific error.  I also recommend visiting Overleaf’s documentation and guide, as that will teach much more of the basics and will give you a better idea of the possibilities of LaTeX.  Go on and create your own $\LaTeX$ documents!&lt;/p&gt;
